**Graduate:**
  - [MVCOMP08](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=539958){:target="_blank"} - "Advanced Image Processing Analysis"<br>
<span style="color: gray;"><i>In this course we cover advanced techniques for image processing. 
Image alignment, segmentation, enhancement/restoration (super-resolution, denoising, inpainting, coloring, i.e. image-to-image "translation") and saliency.</i></span>
  - [PRODEI040](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=540893){:target="_blank"} - "Analysis of Social and Information Networks"<br>
<span style="color: gray;"><i>Many complex problems can be naturally represented as graphs, capturing relationships between objects. 
Such networks are fundamental for modeling social, technological, and biological systems. 
This course explores machine learning with graphs, focusing on the computational, algorithmic, and modeling challenges associated with analyzing large-scale graphs.</i></span>
