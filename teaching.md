### Graduate
  - MIA002 - "Topics in Intelligent Systems"<br>
<span style="color: gray;"><i>This is essentially a Statistical Learning course. An introduction to Bayes decision theory, geometric interpretations and analytical 
derivations considering the Gaussian classifier (in multiple scenarios). Basic principles of Maximum-likelihood estimation. Mixture models and incomplete data. The EM algorithm.</i></span><br>
[2025](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=559506){:target="_blank"} 
  - MEIC001 - "Machine Learning"<br>
<span style="color: gray;"><i>The Machine Learning techniques covered in this course are essentially focused on relational data on tabular formats.
Knowledge extraction, outlier detection and feature engineering are among some of the topics discussed. Classification, clustering, regression. Online learning, frequent pattern mining.</i></span><br>

  - MVCOMP08 - "Advanced Image Processing Analysis"<br>
<span style="color: gray;"><i>In this course we cover advanced techniques for image processing. 
Image alignment, segmentation, enhancement/restoration (super-resolution, denoising, inpainting, coloring, i.e. image-to-image "translation") and saliency.</i></span><br>
[2025](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=539958){:target="_blank"} 
  - PRODEI040 - "Analysis of Social and Information Networks"<br>
<span style="color: gray;"><i>Many complex problems can be naturally represented as graphs, capturing relationships between objects. 
Such networks are fundamental for modeling social, technological, and biological systems. 
This course explores machine learning with graphs, focusing on the computational, algorithmic, and modeling challenges associated with analyzing large-scale graphs.</i></span><br>
