After two years as a Postdoctoral Fellow at INESCTEC in Porto, Portugal, I have decided to move to London, UK.
I am excited to join Huawei R&D as a Senior Research Scientist in the Computer Vision Group (Noahâ€™s Ark Lab). 
Huawei is at the forefront of computational photography, producing some of the best consumer digital photography products on the market.
This new role presents a challenging and rewarding opportunity that I hope will be mutually beneficial for both myself and the company.

I will continue to collaborate with INESCTEC as a scientific advisor, as I am currently supervising students pursuing their PhD and MSc degrees.
