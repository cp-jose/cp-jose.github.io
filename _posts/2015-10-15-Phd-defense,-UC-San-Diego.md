Today marks a day of celebration and the culmination of a tremendous effort. 
I have officially earned my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of California, San Diego (USA), 
following the successful defense of my thesis titled [_"Adaptation of Visual Models with Cross-modal Regularization"_](http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/people/josecp/files/PhDThesis_JoseCostaPereira.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
