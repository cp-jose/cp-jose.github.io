After the commencement ceremony, it’s time to pack. 
When I first came to the USA, I knew I might be tempted to _'stick around for a while'_ after completing my PhD. 
However, after careful consideration, I’ve decided to begin my postdoctoral career back in the old continent.
I’m excited to announce that I’ll be joining INESCTEC, a research institute in my hometown of Porto, Portugal
