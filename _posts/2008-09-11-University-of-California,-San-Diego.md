This marks the beginning of a new chapter in my life. 
After working in industry for the past eight years, I have decided to leave it behind to pursue a dream 
that has been growing in my heart: a career in research. 
The journey begins here, at the [_University of California, San Diego_](https://www.ucsd.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
I am thrilled to have been admitted to the doctoral program in _Intelligent Systems, Robotics, and Control_ 
within the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. The Fall quarter starts now!
