I am excited to announce that I joined University of Porto, Portugal, 
as an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the
[_School of Engineering_](https://www.up.pt/feup/en/){:target="_blank"}.

After six incredible years at Huawei Technologies R&D in London, this move marks a return to my _alma mater_!
