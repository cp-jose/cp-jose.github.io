I am excited to announce that I have recently joined University of Porto (Portugal), 
as an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the
[_School of Engineering_](https://www.up.pt/feup/en/){:target="_blank"}.

After six incredible years at Huawei Technologies R&D in London, this is a great move that marks the return to my _alma mater_!
